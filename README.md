[00:01.29] Lights out
[00:03.63] I'm calling from a thousand miles away
[00:09.03] You're goin' 'bout your day
[00:11.08] While I've been struggling to catch my sleep
[00:14.50] The days start blending into weeks
[00:17.41] It feels like we don't have a thing to say
[00:38.41] 
[00:21.32] 'Cause I haven't seen your face in months
[00:24.23] And you just think I'm out of touch
[00:27.52] But it's not fair, I'm everywhere while you're just waiting
[00:32.31] For someone who can give enough
[00:35.20] When life's been dealing all too much
[00:53.70] 
[00:39.07] I'm hating how it played out on the day I had to leave
[00:43.97] 'Cause now I'm scared to love the thought of you
[00:47.25] The way you did with me
[00:49.51] I know you'll break and bend, and meet your end before I'll ever be
[00:54.88] The one to fall for someone I could barely see
[01:17.88] 
[01:12.12] Right now
[01:14.42] I think you hope we're farther than we've come
[01:19.95] But so much time has gone
[01:22.04] Like, how'd I end up at your family home?
[01:25.42] While mine has only seen you once
[01:28.35] I hate how we skipped past the parts I want
[01:49.85] 
[01:32.28] But it's feeling like it's all too rushed
[01:35.14] And you just think I'm out of touch
[01:38.47] But it's not fair, I'm everywhere while you're just waiting
[02:07.97] 
[01:44.56] I'm hating how it played out on the day I had to leave
[01:49.50] 'Cause now I'm scared to love the thought of you
[01:52.72] The way you did with me
[01:54.96] I know you'll break and bend, and meet your end before I'll ever be
[02:00.37] The one to fall for someone I could barely see
[02:23.37] 
[02:07.25] You're holding on, I'm holding out
[02:12.67] You're looking up as I let you down
[02:17.10] You look at me a certain way that I just can't reciprocate so well
[02:24.17] I'm sorry that you fell
[02:35.67] 
[02:27.64] 'Cause now I'm hating how it played out on the day I had to leave
[02:33.01] And now I'm scared to love the thought of you the way you did with me
[02:38.67] I know you'll break and bend, and meet your end before I'll ever be
[02:43.96] The one to fall for someone I could barely see
[03:06.96] 
[03:00.83] I'm hating how it played out on the day I had to leave
[03:05.80] 'Cause now I'm scared to love the thought of you
[03:09.06] The way you did with me
[03:11.22] I know you'll break and bend, and meet your end before I'll ever be
[03:16.77] The one to fall for someone I could barely see
